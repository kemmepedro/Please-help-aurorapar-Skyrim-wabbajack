# Please-help-aurorapar-Skyrim-wabbajack
Hey @aurorapar man I saw your post saying that you managed to work out the error of "wabbajack.current" already being used by other process in another thread here. But the thing is I tried to change the %localappdata%/wabbajack to other name like %localappdata%/wabbajack2 but the error message still appears!!!Could you help me, please, man?
