# Please-help-aurorapar-Skyrim-wabbajack

Hey @aurorapar man I saw your post saying that you managed to work out the error of "wabbajack.current" already being used by other process in another thread here. But the thing is I tried to change the %localappdata%/wabbajack to other name like %localappdata%/wabbajack2 but the error message still appears!!! Could you help me, please, man?

My email is pedrockemmerich@gmail.com

If you could just tell me If I renamed the wrong folder or if there's anything else that I should do, I would be eternally grateful, seriously.
