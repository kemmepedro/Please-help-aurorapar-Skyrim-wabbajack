Hey @aurorapar man I saw your post saying that ou managed to work out the error of "wabbajack.current" already being used by other process in another thread here. But the thing is I tried to change the %localappdata%/wabbajack to other name like %localappdata%/wabbajack2 but the error message still appears!!! Did I do it wrong?? Could you help me, please, man? I've created an account here just for this lol
